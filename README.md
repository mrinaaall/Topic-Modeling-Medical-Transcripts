# Topic-Modeling-Medical-Transcripts-LDA-NMF

Topic Modeling is the process of mining key words from a corpus of documents, grouping keywords into a topic, and using these topics to classify documents based on their keywords. This idea has been used on a corpus of medical transcripts to provide a brief topic of each doctor visit. In this case, a topic will be a set of organs and body parts, ailments associated with them, and procedures to remedy said ailments.
These topics will be very useful for physicians for a num- ber of reasons. First, a doctor may forget what transpired during a visit, and the keywords of the visitâ€™s topic can easily allow them to pick up where they dropped off. Second, a physician can use the topics of the visits to identify patients with similar issues, which can be crucial for developing a prognosis, as a doctor can build off of what has worked in the past.

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a type of dimen- sionality reduction that was created to be a variant of PCA that is easier to interpret.
